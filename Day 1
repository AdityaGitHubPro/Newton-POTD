Problem Statement
Given is a positive integer N, where none of the digits is 0. Let k be the number of digits in N. We want to make a multiple of 3 by erasing at least 0 and at most k−1 digits from N and concatenating the remaining digits without changing the order. Determine whether it is possible to make a multiple of 3 in this way. If it is possible, find the minimum number of digits that must be erased to make such a number.
Input
The input consists of a single integer N.

Constraints
1≤N≤10^18

None of the digits in N is 0.
Output
If it is impossible to make a multiple of 3, print -1; otherwise, print the minimum number of digits that must be erased to make such a number.
